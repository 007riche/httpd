Variables
---------

The Travis scripts use the following environment variables:

* APR_VERSION - if set, APR of this version is built and installed
  in $HOME/root/apr-$APR_VERSION (trunk means trunk is used)

* APR_CONFIG - arguments to pass when running APR's configure script
  if APR_VERSION is set

* APU_VERSION - if set, APR-util of this version is built and
  installed in $HOME/root/apu-$APU_VERSION (trunk means trunk is used)

* APU_CONFIG - arguments to pass when running APR-util's configure
  script if APU_VERSION is set

* CONFIG - arguments to pass to httpd's configure script.

* SKIP_TESTING - if set, the Perl test framework is not run for the
  build.

Caching
-------

Perl modules installed in $HOME/perl5 are cached.

Anything installed into the $HOME/root directory is cached - notably,
versions of APR/APR-util are installed here and cached across httpd
build jobs without needing to be rebuilt every time.
