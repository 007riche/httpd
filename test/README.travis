Variables
---------

The Travis scripts use the following environment variables:

* APR_VERSION - if set, APR of this version is built and installed
  in $HOME/root/apr-$APR_VERSION (trunk means trunk is used)

* APR_CONFIG - arguments to pass when running APR's configure script
  if APR_VERSION is set

* APU_VERSION - if set, APR-util of this version is built and
  installed in $HOME/root/apu-$APU_VERSION

* APU_CONFIG - arguments to pass when running APR-util's configure
  script if APU_VERSION is set

* CONFIG - arguments to pass to httpd's configure script.

* BUILDCONFIG - arguments to pass when running httpd's ./buildconf script

* MFLAGS - arguments to pass when running "make" for httpd.

* SKIP_TESTING - if set, the Perl test framework is not run for the
  build.

Caching
-------

Perl modules installed in $HOME/perl5 are cached.

Anything installed into the $HOME/root directory is cached - notably,
versions of APR/APR-util are installed here and cached across httpd
build jobs without needing to be rebuilt every time.

TODO list
---------

* MacOS build
* Windows build
* clang-on-Linux build
* Multi-arch testing
 - non-x86_64 images lack installed cpanminus and don't enable caching.
   ppc64le builds seem unreasonably slow to install CPAN deps each time
   (15-20 minutes) - not sure why.  s390x is enabled & seems reasonably fast.
* Use containers for non-Ubuntu-based Linux testing
* E-mail notifications
* VPATH builds
* sanity checks for use of APLOGNO() - empty arguments, accidental duplicates, etc.
 - not sure how exactly
